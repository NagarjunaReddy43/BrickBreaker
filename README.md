# BrickBreaker
We made an interactive game based upon the classic game brick breaker. The object of brick breaker is to break the bricks that are distributed around the top of the game screen. The bricks are broken after coming in contact with a ball that bounces around the screen. 
Some of you already know about the brick breaker game. It has a small ball that hits the bricks with the help of a little platform at the bottom.
The player uses this platform to bounce the ball. The more you break the bricks, the more you score.
If you miss the ball to bounce then game over. This project is for beginners and gives a basic overview of the game. 
It will definitely help you with your first-year project or as a fun purpose implementation. 
The following are the milestones of the project implementation.
      1.Display bricks and disappear after hitting the ball.
      2.Small platform moving left and right
      3.The ball must bounce after hitting brick and platform at the bottom
      4.Score display
